Yesterday I did 3 interview panels for 2 portfolio director jobs I have open. I am so grateful for those on the panel. It is a reminder of why I love working at the church. Each interview starts with a prayer, which would seem weird at many other companies. I am grateful.

  


I had lunch with Skidmore, Jason and Vance - lightly exploring if there is a match for Vance at the Church. It was nice to combine the work side of my life with the family side.
