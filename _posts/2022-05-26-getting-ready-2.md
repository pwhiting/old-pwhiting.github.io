This year, we ride from Kansas City to St. Louis. I’ve been spending extra time over the last few weeks getting ride miles in, but we are definitely not in the same shape we’ve been in for previous rides. We are leaving the day after high school lets out.




This year we will be hauling our trailer because we intend to camp far more nights than in the past. We will be riding on the Rock Island Trail and Katy Trail. Our plan is to ride about 600 miles across two weeks.
