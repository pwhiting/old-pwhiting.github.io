We are Natalie and Pete, avid cyclists who are dipping our toes in the waters of bike touring. We ride a big, long, orange, somewhat-heavy (but awesome) recumbent tandem. We also road and mountain bike. We are passionate about the environment and love spending time together in the beautiful outdoors. We created this blog to track our adventures through Europe this summer:  route-finding, searching for accommodations, and eating vegan. Although we really like biking, we are also adoring grandparents of three, so if we don't post too often it's probably their cute fault.
