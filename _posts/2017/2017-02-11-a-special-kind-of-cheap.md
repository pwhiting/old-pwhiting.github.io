I just spent an hour trying to save $15 on a jacket for Natalie. Splitting the value of my time evenly with the salesperson, we are both valued at $7.50 hour. I'm a special kind of cheap.

My desire to get a few bucks off really doesn't make sense when you consider that the jacket is too expensive even at $15, $25 or $40 off. I already crossed the "money is no object" barrier when I decided to get a Patagonia Houdini jacket for Natalie. It is super light, super compact, and waterproof - which is what we need to fit 3 weeks of clothing and gear into luggage about half the size of a normal carry on.
