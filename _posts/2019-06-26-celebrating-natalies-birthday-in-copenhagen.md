(with some commentary by Natalie)

We slept medium well in the campsite last night. It was better than wild camping as having a toilet and shower made a huge difference. We were definitely ready to stay in an Airbnb again.

We started riding a bit late and took our time. Our old bodies were feeling the effect of the previous 2 days. I think the sun beating down on us as we exert ourselves is probably draining us the most. Luckily today's ride was short -- 20 miles from where we camped (Niva) to Copenhagen. It was unseasonably warm today, apparently, about mid 80sF. As we rode along the road by the beach, we found a little ice cream stand with some kind of delicious berry sorbet! Just what we needed.

Natalie spotted an interesting looking healthy fast food place as we rode into the outskirts of Copenhagen. It was called KCAL Factory. She had an amazing salad and I had an avocado sandwich. I realize we were famished, hot, and tired -- but I think it might have been the best meal we've had on one of these rides. Perfect, as today is Natalie's birthday.

We checked into a cozy Airbnb which had a pool, so I took advantage of it. It felt so good to jump into the water. I hope we get to go swimming in the ocean while we are here. But mostly I hope we find some hot pools like we enjoyed in Iceland. My body needs a good long recovery soak.

We walked around Copenhagen in the afternoon. At first I was feeling quite drained, but eating an extra meal and getting more fluids in me helped me keep up with Natalie. (Have any of you tried walking with her?)

Copenhagen is a beautiful, interesting city, with colorful, lovely architecture -- both old and modern. We loved the city's greenspaces as well as pedestrian-only shopping areas. Nyhavn is an especially fun area too. We took a self-guided walking tour of some of the more scenic streets and sights. It was just right.

At the end of our tour of the city we found a small Thai restaurant in central Copenhagen that was amazing, called Wokshop. It was a proper way to celebrate Natalie's birthday. We rode the train back to our Airbnb and spent the evening winding down. We're feeling ready for tomorrow.
