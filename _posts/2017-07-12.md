# Amsterdam day
(Natalie writing) I'm going to try to be concise, as we're waking early tomorrow (early for this trip's standards but not our normal life).  We biked 15 minutes in the rain to the airport, with minimal gear. Spent 2 hours taking apart the bike and packing it in its two boxes for our flight home tomorrow. Paid to have it stored overnight. Found a train into the city.  We opted for another boat tour ride, and we liked it. It was warm and covered from the rain, for one thing, and it gave some interesting highlights about the city, its architecture, and its history. By the time it was finished the rain was slowing. (It eventually stopped but then gave way to quite a strong chilly wind.) We walked around as we enjoy doing. We found good things to eat too. We waited an extremely long time to go through the Anne Frank House. The museum is beautifully simple, well done, sobering, and moving. It is a meaningful tribute to Anne and all she represents. We are glad we went. But we would very strongly recommend you get online scheduled tickets in advance if you go. Walked around some more, found more food, and then decided to walk back to our AirBnB instead of navigating the public transit. The evening was cool but much less windy, and we had a very nice brisk walk through several beautiful and interesting parts of the city and its environs, including the lovely Vondelpark (Central Park on a smaller scale). Travel day tomorrow. Europe, it's been great! You've been good to us and our bike. We will be back!!!
