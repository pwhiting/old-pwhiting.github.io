# Packing our bike
So many people ask us how we get our bike to the place will start from. I made a one minute video which does a time lapse of that process.

  https://youtu.be/Uf8aahsuUWI  I worked really hard this time to keep both Bike boxes at or below 50 pounds. Both of them are between 48 and 50 pounds cause I’m cheap and the cost per box steps up $100 each at 50 pounds. They are each right at 50 and there aren’t other things I can do to reduce them further, so I am hoping they don’t pick up any weight from the rain storm as we transport them to the airport.
