We started our adventure by driving from Salt Lake to Kansas City, through Nebraska. The drive was happily uneventful. It's a long drive, but we were able to do it all in one day. We didn't arrive at Mary and Zack's home until about 11pm, and then we visited with them for a bit before crashing. Natalie was thrilled that one firefly followed us into their house when we arrived! Mary caught it, and we tried to get a few pictures of it before she released it in their backyard.
