Our heroes change as our interests change. Today I tip my hat to Ethel MacDonald of Missoula Montana. Ethel is a great grandmother who took up tour cycling at the age of 65 and now, approaching 80, has put down 10,000 miles around the world solo riding on her pink Brompton folding bike (she actually has two bikes - a second one is stashed with a friend in Europe, making it easier for her to ride there.)

[Here](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/08/travel/ethel-macdonald-cycling/) is a CNN article about her.

Respect.
