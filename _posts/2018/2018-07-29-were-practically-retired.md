Super restful day today. We slept in, had a nice breakfast, went to church, had a nice lunch, went to a concert at another church, had dinner, and are finishing the day with hot chocolate. The only thing missing was another soak at the pool.

The weather has been nice, with a light rain in the afternoon. Right now it looks like we will have decent weather for at least the next 3 days -- possibly to the end of the week. Our fingers are crossed....

We have less than 250 miles left, but 3 significant climbs and at least one full day of difficult traffic. This thing isn't over yet!

We've enjoyed our rest days in Akureyri and are ready to start again tomorrow.
