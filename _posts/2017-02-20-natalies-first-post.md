Yes, this is Natalie. I'll be posting here sometimes too. I'm here to let you know that I am seriously excited about this trip to Europe -- AND our future trips as well! I am already thinking about Iceland, which is where I want us to go next. ?  So to all of you who think Pete is the only one excited about this, Nope! I am SOOO excited! I really really really am enjoying the bike, even more than I anticipated! And it was honestly not hard to get used to, as I feared it might be. I have loved all our longer distance road bike rides, and this is a way we can "see the world" but still have adventures too. It allows us to travel together more, in a way Pete will like better, and in a way I will love too. So stay tuned!
