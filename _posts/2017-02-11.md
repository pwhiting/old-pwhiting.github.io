# A special kind of cheap
I just spent an hour trying to save $15 on a jacket for Natalie. Splitting the value of my time evenly with the salesperson, we are both valued at $7.50 hour. I'm a special kind of cheap. My desire to get a few bucks off really doesn't make sense when you consider that the jacket is too expensive even at $15, $25 or $40 off. I already crossed the "money is no object" barrier when I decided to get a Patagonia Houdini jacket for Natalie. It is super light, super compact, and waterproof - which is what we need to fit 3 weeks of clothing and gear into luggage about half the size of a normal carry on.

# Second ride
We rode our tandem again today. This time we rode from North Salt Lake to the marina, about 43 miles. We had a headwind both ways. I'm not kidding. We made a few rookie mistakes putting the bike together (it has to fold in half to fit in our truck) but everything turned out fine. One thing I like the most about this bike is that we can easily talk to each other while we ride.
